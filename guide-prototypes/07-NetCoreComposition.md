Chapter 7: Composition Operators
=================================

A key feature of the NetCore design is its support for modular
construction of SDN policies:  One can build complex policies
by combining a collection of simpler ones.  In this chapter,
we will describe two key *composition operators* that make this
possible.

A Port Mapping Policy
----------------------

Our goal in this subsection will be to adapt the simple repeater 
from [Chapter 6](06-NetCoreIntroduction.md) so that instead of simply
acting as a repeater, our switch does some packet rewriting.  More
specifically, we will create a switch that maps connections initiated by host 
<code>h1</code>
and destined to TCP port 5022 to the standard SSH port 22.  To do
so, we'll have to learn about several new NetCore features including
*packet modification actions,* *sequential composition* and the *pass*
action.

### Packet Modifications

In general, packet modifications are written as follows:
```
field pre-value -> post-value
```
When executing such an action, the switch tests the <code>field</code>
to determine whether it holds the <code>pre-value</code>.  If it does,
then the field is rewritten to the <code>post-value</code>.  If it
does not, then the packet is dropped.  For instance,
```
tcpDstPort 5022 -> 22
```
rewrites the <code>tcpDstPort</code> of packets from 5022 to 22.

### Sequential Composition

Now, policies can mix modification and forwarding actions, but we need a way to
pipe the output of one policy in to the next.  For this, we use
the *sequential composition* operator (<code>;</code>).  You should
think of the sequential composition <code>P1; P2</code> as a kind 
of *function composition* that processes
each packet using the function corresponding <code>P1</code> first, generating
a multi-set of zero, one or more intermediate packets <code>{p1,...,pk}</code>, and 
then applies the function corresponding to <code>P2</code> 
to each intermediate packet <code>pi</code>, returning some number of
final result packets.

As a simple first example, consider
```
tcpDstPort 5022 -> 22; fwd(1)
```
the first action produces a packet with <code>tcpDstPort</code> equal to
22 in the same place it started.  The second action takes that intermediate
result and produces a new packet at port 1.  Now consider the following
variation:
```
fwd(1); tcpDstPort 5022 -> 22
```
It is semantically equivalent to the first.  The <code>fwd</code>
action creates a new packet at port 1 and the modification changes the
<code>tcpDstPort</code> afterwards.  More interesting still,
```
all; tcpDstPort 5022 -> 22
```
moves the packet to <code>all</code> ports (except the one it came in on)
and rewrites all of them.

### Exercise

What does the policy <code>drop; all</code> do?  Why?

### The Pass Action

We need one more concept in order to write an elegant port-mapper program:
The <code>pass</code> action.  This action acts like the identity function on
packets. In other words, it simply pipes all of its input packets through
untouched to its output.  Hence, <code>pass</code> has the property that both
<code>pass; P</code> and <code>P; pass</code> are exactly the same as just
<code>P</code>.  At first, it seems as though
this makes <code>pass</code> a completely useless construct, but it turns out
to be essential in combination with other features of NetCore.

### And Finally, the Port Mapper

Now, the port translation program:
```
let mapper =
  if inPort = 1 && tcpDstPort = 5022 then
    tcpDstPort 5022 -> 22
  else if inPort = 2 && tcpSrcPort = 22 then
    tcpSrcPort 22 -> 5022
  else
    pass

let routing = 
  all

let forwarder =
  mapper; routing
```
The <code>mapper</code> component rewrites the destination port in one
direction and the source port in the other, if those ports
take on the given values entering the switch.  Notice how we
used <code>pass</code> in the final <code>else</code> branch of the 
<code>mapper</code> policy to leave packets of all other kinds
untouched.  This allows us to compose the mapper component
with any routing component we choose.  In this case, <code>forwarder</code>
is defined by composing <code>mapper</code> with the trivial <code>all</code>
routing policy.  However, in a more complex network, the routing
component could be arbitrarily sophisticated and still compose
properly with the mapper.

Testing the Port Mapper
-----------------------

You will find the mapper in <code>Port_Map.nc</code>.  Start it up
with frenetic.
```
$ frenetic Port_Map.nc
```
Then start mininet in the default topology, and
simulate an SSH process listening on port 22 on host <code>h2</code>:
```
$ sudo mn --controller=remote
mininet> h2 iperf -s -p 22 &
```
You can connect to <code>h2</code> (IP address 10.0.0.2) 
from <code>h1</code> by establishing a connection to port 5022
using the command below.  (The <code>-t</code> option specifies
the time window for sending traffic.)
The mapper will translate port numbers for you.
```
mininet> h1 iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -p 5022 -t 0.0001
```
You shoud see a trace like the following:
```
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to 10.0.0.2, TCP port 5022
TCP window size: 22.9 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 10.0.0.1 port 52273 connected with 10.0.0.2 port 5022
[ ID] Interval       Transfer     Bandwidth
[  3]  0.0- 0.0 sec   128 KBytes   149 Mbits/sec
```
You can also test that the network still allows ping traffic:
```
mininet> h1 ping -c 1 h2
```

Composing Queries
-----------------

When developing more complex policies, it is very useful to peer into the
middle of the network.  Hence, NetCore supports several kinds of queries that
can help you understand and debug the behavior of your network.  As an example,
the <code>monitorPackets(label)</code> policy sends every input packet it
receives to the controller as opposed to forwarding it along a network data
path (like the <code>fwd(port)</code> policy does).  At the controller, the
packet is printed with the string <code>label</code> as a prefix and then
discarded.

Interestingly, when one monitors a network, one does so *in parallel* with some
standard forwarding policy; one would like the packets to go *two* places:  the
controller, for inspection, and wherever they may be destined in the network.
To support this idiom, we must introduce a new kind of operator on policies:
*parallel composition*.  Intuitively, when supplied with a packet
<code>p</code> as input, the parallel composition <code>P1 + P2</code> applies
<code>P1</code> to <code>p</code> and also, independently,
applies <code>P2</code> to a second copy of
<code>p</code>.  Overall, it generates the *union* of the results from
<code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code>.  Hence, if <code>P1</code> forwards to A
and <code>P1</code> forwards to B then <code>P1 + P2</code> makes a copy of the
input packet and forwards to both A and B.

With this in mind, let's modify the port mapper to inspect the packets both
before and after the rewriting.  We can leave the mapper component unchanged
and add monitoring to the forwarder.
```
...
let before = if inPort = 1 then monitorPackets("BEFORE")
let after = if inPort = 1 then monitorPackets("AFTER")

let forwarder =
  (before + mapper); (all + after)
```
Above, we used a 
<code>if</code>-<code>then</code> statement (no else) to limit the packets
that reach the monitoring policy to only those packets satisfying
the <code>inPort = 1</code> predicate.  Otherwise, the monitor policy
prints *all* packets that reach it.  Note that if there is no <code>else</code>
branch in a conditional, packets not matching the conditional are dropped
(i.e., in this second case, the conditional produces the empty set of result
packets).

This new policy can be found in <code>Port_Map_Monitor1.nc</code>.
Test it as above using iperf, but this time watch the output in the 
controller window.  You should see lines similar to the following being printed:
```
[BEFORE] packet dlSrc=4a:f7:98:81:78:0d,dlDst=d6:7c:1e:d6:e3:0b,nwSrc=10.0.0.1,nwDst=10.0.0.2,tpSrc=52923;tpDst=5022 on switch 1 port 1
[AFTER] packet dlSrc=4a:f7:98:81:78:0d,dlDst=d6:7c:1e:d6:e3:0b,nwSrc=10.0.0.1,nwDst=10.0.0.2,tpSrc=52923;tpDst=22 on switch 1 port 1
```
You will notice <code>tpDst=5022</code> in lines marked
<code>BEFORE</code> and <code>tpDst=22</code> in lines marked 
<code>AFTER</code>.

Monitoring Load
---------------

Another useful query measures the load at different places in the network.  The
<code>monitorLoad(n, label)</code> policy prints the number of packets and
bytes it receives every <code>n</code> seconds.  Each output line from this
query is prefixed by the
string <code>label</code>, and we can restrict the packets monitored by
<code>monitorLoad</code> using <code>if</code>-<code>then</code> clauses.
Note that the implementation 
of <code>monitorLoad</code> is far more efficient 
than <code>monitorPackets</code> as the former does not send packets 
to the controller.

<code>Port_Map_Monitor2.nc</code> contains a variation of the port mapper 
that monitors load instead of packets.  You can test it by
issuing a longer iperf request 
(adjust the timing parameter <code>-t seconds</code>).  Watch the load 
printed in the controller terminal.
The following command runs iperf for <code>20</code> seconds.
```
mininet> h1 iperf -c 10.0.0.2 -p 5022 -t 20
```

Under the Hood
--------------

Sequential and parallel composition make it easier to write SDN controller
programs, but it all gets compiled to OpenFlow rules in the end.  To get a feel
for how the compiler works, let's take another look at a NetCore version of the
efficient firewall from the [OxFirewall](03-OxFirewall.md) chapter, altering it
slightly to block SSH rather than ICMP traffic:
```
let firewall = if !(tcpDstPort = 22) then all in
monitorTable(1, firewall)
```

We added a table query to show the flow table that NetCore produces for the
firewall.  Now, fire up the firewall
([Ox_Firewall.nc](netcore-tutorial-code/Ox_Firewall.nc)).  You should see the
following output:
```
$ frenetic netcore-tutorial-code/Ox_Firewall.nc
Flow table at switch 1 is:
 {dlTyp = ip, nwProto = tcp, tpDst = 22} => []
 {*} => [Output AllPorts]
 {*} => [Output AllPorts]
```

As you can see from the latter two rules, NetCore is less efficient 
(in terms of switch rule space used) than a
human programmer.  (But not for long, we hope!)  Nevertheless, this should look
very similar to the flow table you programmed.

Now, let's add a query to monitor traffic for <code>h1</code>:
```
let firewall = if !(tcpDstPort = 22) then all in
let monitor = if srcIP = 10.0.0.1 then monitorLoad(10, "From H1") in
monitorTable(1, firewall + monitor)
```

The flow table should look something like this:
```
$ frenetic netcore-tutorial-code/Ox_Firewall_Monitor.nc
Flow table at switch 1 is:
 {dlTyp = ip, nwSrc = 10.0.0.1, nwProto = tcp, tpDst = 22} => []
 {dlTyp = ip, nwProto = tcp, tpDst = 22} => []
 {dlTyp = ip, nwSrc = 10.0.0.1} => [Output AllPorts]
 {*} => [Output AllPorts]
```

Let's break it down, rule by rule:
* **Rule 1**: drop SSH traffic from <code>h1</code>.
* **Rule 2**: drop SSH traffic.
* **Rule 3**: forward traffic from <code>h1</code>.
* **Rule 4**: forward all other traffic.

Why so many rules?  OpenFlow switches can only count packets as they match a
rule.  Rule 1, for example, is necessary to precisely count traffic from <code>h1</code>.
Without it, our query would miss any SSH traffic sent from <code>h1</code>, as it would be
lumped in with all the other SSH traffic dropped by rule 2.

In general, NetCore creates a flow table for two policies joined by parallel
composition (<code>P1 + P2</code>) by creating flow tables for <code>P1</code>
and <code>P2</code>, and taking the Cartesian product of these tables, and then
concatenating the original tables.  The result looks like this:

![Parallel composition.][parallel_composition]

Section **A** in the flow table is the Cartesian product.  Packets that match
both <code>P1</code> and <code>P2</code> are matched here.  Because **A** is
given a higher priority, any packets that reach **B** or **C** may match
<code>P1</code> *or* <code>P2</code>, but not both.

As an aside, NetCore policies are total functions: they always process every
packet, even if that "processing" is simply to drop it.  Hence, NetCore adds a
final, catch-all rule to the flow table to drop packets that are not matched
higher up.

Programming Exercise: A Multi-Switch Network
---------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will explore how to construct a policy for
a multi-switch network using the composition operators discussed
in this chapter.  You should also practice using queries to help
debug your program.  The network under consideration has 3 switches, 
and one host attached to each switch: 

![Simple linear topology.][topo_2]

You can start such a network when you boot up mininet:
```
$ sudo mn --controller=remote --topo=linear,3
```
Your goals are to implement a policy that performs the following
actions:
  - broadcast all arp packets to all hosts
  - route other packets to the correct host using their destination 
IP address.  Host h1 has IP address 10.0.0.1, host h2 has
IP address 10.0.0.2 and host h3 has IP address 10.0.0.3.
  - prevent host h2 from contacting h3's web server by
dropping all packets from source IP 10.0.0.2 destined for source
IP 10.0.0.3 with desintation TCP port 80.

Moreover, the goal is to design the policy in a modular fashion.
To that end, we have provided you with a template to start from in
<code>Multi_Switch.nc</code>.  The template defines independent components
that should implement IP routing for switches s1, s2, and s3.  There is
also a component for defining a firewall policy.  After defining the
individual components, assemble them using the appropriate
composition operators.

To test your policy, fire up mininet with the linear 3-switch topology:
```
$ sudo mn --controller=remote --topo=linear,3
```
Then start your <code>Multi_Switch.nc</code> program:
```
$ frenetic tut3.nc
```
In mininet, start a web server on host h3:
```
mininet> h3 python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 . &
```
Check that you can fetch content from the server at h3 from h1:
```
mininet> h1 wget -O - h3
```
Make sure h3's web server is inaccessible from from h2:
```
mininet> h2 wget -O - h3
```
You can find a solution in <code>Sol_Multi_Switch.nc</code>.
