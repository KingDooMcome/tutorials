In the preceding tutorials, you learnt how to program networks using Frenetic.  In this tutorial, we will show you how to write even more sophisticated Frenetic programs. These programs require the full power of a general-purpose programming language -- they are beyond the scope of Frenetic alone. Therefore, you will instead write these programs in _OCaml_ and use Frenetic as a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in OCaml.

We assume you're familiar with both Frenetic and OCaml programming.
