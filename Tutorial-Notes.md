* Add instructions on how to reset the VM and Mininet when things shutdown unexpectedly.

* For [Monitor Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/04-OxMonitor) consider adding sample test results after Programming Exercises 1 and 2 (unless we are expected get the same results as the first traffic monitoring Programming Task, then state that)

* For [Learning Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/05-OxLearning), add sample test results for the Efficient Learning Switch. Is the `switch_connected` function needed?

* For the [NCFirewall Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/07-NCFirewall), when running fortune on `h1`, `h3` and `h4` timeout when running curl. Is this expected behavior? When running fortune on `h3`, `h4` times out when running curl instead of connecting.

* Need to find some place for the netkat tutorial workspace and solutions.
