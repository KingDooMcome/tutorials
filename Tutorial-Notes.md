* Add instructions on how to reset the VM and Mininet when things shutdown unexpectedly.

* For [Firewall Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/03-OxFirewall) and [Learning Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/05-OxLearning) , wrong type for `switch_connected`. (SwitchFeatures.t argument is missing after the Core.switchId argument)
