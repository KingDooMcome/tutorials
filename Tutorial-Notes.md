* Add instructions on how to reset the VM and Mininet when things shutdown unexpectedly.

* For [Firewall Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/03-OxFirewall) and [Learning Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/05-OxLearning) , wrong type for `switch_connected`. (SwitchFeatures.t argument is missing after the Core.switchId argument)

* For [Monitor Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/04-OxMonitor) consider adding sample test results after Programming Exercises 1 and 2 (unless we are expected get the same results as the first traffic monitoring Programming Task, then state that)

* For [Learning Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/05-OxLearning), add sample test results for the Efficient Learning Switch. Is the `switch_connected` function needed?

* There are two Chapter 7's and two Chapter 8's. The [NetCore Composition Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/07-NetCoreComposition) contains repeated information from the [NCMonitoring Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/09-NCMonitoring)

* Update links on [WrapUp Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/10-WrapUp)

* The [Using Frenetic from OCaml](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/Using-Frenetic-from-OCaml) page is unfinished. (There is no tutorial)

* For the [NCFirewall Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/07-NCFirewall), when running fortune on `h1`, `h3` and `h4` timeout when running curl. Is this expected behavior? When running fortune on `h3`, `h4` times out when running curl instead of connecting.

* In the [NetCore Composition Chapter](https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic/wiki/07-NetCoreComposition), specify where Port_Map.nc and other example code can be found (`~/src/frenetic/examples/`)
