Chapter 6: Network Address Translator
==========================

In this exercise, you will build a Network Address Translator by first writing and testing a translator function that first translates IP addresses and then extending it so that it translates port numbers as well.

### The Network Address Translating Function

In the 1990s, the explosive growth of the internet created a demand for IP address space. Before NAT was invented, all IP addresses were globally unique. NAT allows private IP addresses to be reused in multiple local area networks (LAN) by translating all private IP addresses in a LAN to one globally unique public IP address. NAT essentially does the following:

* For packets received on private (internal) ports, NAT rewrites the private IP address to the public IP address and installs rules to forward the packet to the public port.
    * NAT will also store relevant information for each packet in a data structure, such as a hashtable.
* For packets received on the public (external) port, NAT checks to see if the TCP port destination of   
  the packet matches the TCP port source of any of the packets stored in the data structure.
    * If so, the public IP address of the packet is rewritten to the corresponding private IP address and        
      rules are installed to forward the packet to the correct private port.
    * If not, the packet is simply dropped.
 
#### Programming Task

You should use the template below to get started. Save it in a file called `Nat1.ml` and place it in the directory `~/src/frenetic/ox-tutorial-workspace/Nat1.ml`.

#### Compiling and Testing

These tests will ensure that TCP packets are being sent and received to the correct hosts and addresses are translated correctly.

 * Build and launch the controller:

  ```shell
  $ make Nat1.d.byte
  $ ./Nat1.d.byte
  ```

 * In a separate terminal window, start Mininet:

  ```shell
  $ sudo mn --controller=remote --topo=single,3 --mac
  ```

We will be using a topology that consists of two internal hosts and one external host connected by a switch.

 * In Mininet, start new terminals for `h1`, `h2`, and `h3`:

  ```
  mininet> xterm h1 h2 h3
  ```

 * In the terminal for `h3`, add static entries into the arp table and start a fortune server.

  ```
  # arp -v -s [public IP address] [public MAC address]
  # while true; do fortune | nc -l 80; done
  ```
  The first command adds a static entry into the arp table that binds your public MAC address to your public   
  IP address.

* In the terminal for `h1`, fetch a fortune from `h3`.
  
  ```
  # curl 10.0.0.3:80
   ```
You shouldâ€™ve received a fortune. Now try to fetch a fortune on the `h2` terminal.

* In the terminal for the controller, check to see that your IP addresses are translating correctly.
  
  ```
  Outgoing flow packetIn{
   total_len=74 port=1 reason=NoMatch
   payload=dlSrc=00:00:00:00:00:01,dlDst=00:00:00:00:00:03,
   nwSrc=10.0.0.1,nwDst=10.0.0.3,tpSrc=42635;tpDst=80 (buffered at 256)                          
  
  Translating Private IP:167772161 to Public IP:167772259.
   ```
* Incoming packets should look similar to this:

  ```
  Non TCP or incoming flow packetIn{
   total_len=74 port=3 reason=NoMatch
   payload=dlSrc=00:00:00:00:00:03,dlDst=00:00:00:00:00:099,
   nwSrc=10.0.0.3,nwDst=10.0.0.99,tpSrc=80;tpDst=42635 (buffered at 257)                                                          
   }
  Found a mapping in the hashtable!
  ```
Notice how this packet matches the outgoing flow packet above.

### PAT - The Port Address Translating Function

PAT is essentially an extension of NAT except in addition, PAT assigns each host
a port number from a list of available port numbers. This prevents confusion in
the extreme case where two hosts in a LAN share the same TCP port number. Although
all hosts in a LAN share the same public IP address, the router will know exactly
which host to forward packets to due to their different port numbers.

#### Programming Task

Modify Nat1.ml to translate port numbers as well.

Specifically,

* Assign each host a public port number.

* For packets received on internal ports, rewrite the original TCP source port 
number with the assigned port number of the host. 

* For packets received on the external port, rewrite the assigned TCP destination
  port number with the original TCP destination port number. 

#### Compiling and Testing 

Compile and test your controller the same way that you did before. 

* In the terminal for the controller, check to see that your IP addresses and port
  numbers are translating correctly.

  ```
  Outgoing flow packetIn{
   total_len=74 port=1 reason=NoMatch
   payload=dlSrc=00:00:00:00:00:01,dlDst=00:00:00:00:00:03,
   nwSrc=10.0.0.1,nwDst=10.0.0.3,tpSrc=42635;tpDst=80 (buffered at 256)                                                                             
   }
  Translating Private IP:167772161:42635 to Public IP:167772259:5000.
  ```

* Incoming packets should look similar to this:
 
  ```
  Non TCP or incoming flow packetIn{
   total_len=74 port=3 reason=NoMatch
   payload=dlSrc=00:00:00:00:00:03,dlDst=00:00:00:00:00:099,
   nwSrc=10.0.0.3,nwDst=10.0.0.99,tpSrc=80;tpDst=5000 (buffered at 257)                                                                          
   }
  Found a mapping in the hashtable!
