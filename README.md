This branch (*gh-pages*) hosts the Frenetic tutorial. When you commit to this
branch, the tutorial website is automatically processed using [GitHub Pages] and
the tutorial website is updated:

  http://frenetic-lang.github.io/tutorials/

You can use the GitHub website to edit anything online. But, if you want to edit
locally, you'll need to checkout the gh-pages branch:

    $ git clone -b gh-pages git@github.com:frenetic-lang/tutorials.git

If you want to preview your changes locally before pushing, you'll need to
install [Jekyll].   Type "jekyll serve" to start up a local server.
